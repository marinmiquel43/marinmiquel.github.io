Hi, I'm Miquel! I strive to bridge the gap between theoretical machine learning and real-world applications.  

I'm a data scientist currently studying a Master of Science in Machine Learning, Data Science and Artificial Intelligence at [Aalto University](https://www.aalto.fi/en). Prior to that, I completed my Bachelor's thesis, working in the generation of datasets for training positron emission tomography image reconstruction methods at the [Department of Applied Mathematics at the Universitat Politècnica de València](https://www.upv.es/entidades/DMAA/index-en.html) under the supervision of [Samuel Morillas](https://www.upv.es/pls/oalu/sic_person.Info?p_alias=smorillas&P_IDIOMA=i).

Related to my current research interests, I like to discuss possible future directions on the Large Language Models field, with a special focus in multimodality and in context learning, in the Artificial Intelligence and Language group.

I'm currently working as a Research Assistant at the [Department of Marketing](https://www.aalto.fi/en/department-of-marketing), studying the value that consumers attribute to artworks created with the assistance of generative AI in art auction sites.

When I was a kid, I used to practice swimming professionally and judo. Right now, in my free time, I like going to the gym, watching movies and travelling.

I thank you for having made it this far. You can reach me at \href{mailto:miquelmarin43@gmail.com}{miquelmarin43@gmail.com}.
